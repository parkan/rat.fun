- Look at room-listing update notification, does it update consistently?
  – Make room-update notification pulsate (color)
  – "Hot/popular" listing filter
  – Arrow of value change (for operator balance at least) seems to be pointing the wrong way
  – Room balance in RoomItem does not seem to update based on other peoples actions

  – Add graph to own room listing items
  – Expand rat 3D view to full screen interface when clicked. Add "rat petting".
